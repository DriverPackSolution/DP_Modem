II.  What is new in Windows XP?

  In WinXP, when the system is booted up it automatically detects the modem and install the modem with in-build drivers when you upgrade your Operating System from Win9x, WinME or Win2K.  
  Allow about 30 seconds for the Windows XP to recognize what type of modem it is installed on the system.  Once windows have finished installing the in-build drivers now you can proceed with the upgrade.
  If your modem is not supported in Windows XP inbuild driver, then XP will ask for you to point windows to the drivers, which we recommend to Cancel.  You need to contact the modem manufacturer for a WinXP suitable driver or you can use the WinXP driver that we provide for the HSF modem.
